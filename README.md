# Loan Default Prediction for GhanaLoanConnect
A machine learning project to predict loan defaults for GhanaLoanConnect, aiming to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) and improve lending decisions.

## 📈 Project Overview
This repository contains:

A complete data analysis and modeling pipeline (Google Colab Notebook).

Preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Business insights and recommendations based on model findings.

Deliverables: final report, and notebook.
